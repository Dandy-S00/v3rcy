## 2025-02-23 - Path Traversal Prevention in Storage Proxy
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized path/key input in `/storage/*` proxy endpoint allowed relative directory traversal (`..`) sequences when retrieving presigned storage URLs.
**Learning:** Dynamic storage proxy routes mapping wildcard URL params to S3 key paths must strictly sanitize relative paths and reject `..` traversal sequences before forwarding to storage backends.
**Prevention:** Always normalize key paths and check for `..` or absolute path indicators prior to generating presigned GET/PUT parameters.
